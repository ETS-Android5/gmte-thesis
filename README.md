# Repository for GMTE-Thesis (2020/2021)

This repository holds all the code written for my GMTE-Thesis at Utrecht University.
The repo is sectioned into three compartments:

#### 1. MTBalance
This is the main application of the thesis, which was used to construct a system which is capable of providing novice mountain bikers with real-time proprioceptive feedback on balance. The code is written in *Java* within the Android studio IDE. All code is fully documented.

#### 2. RTFeedback
Code written for the real-time feedback devices used within the *MTBalance* system, in *C* within the Arduino IDE.

#### 3. Plotting
Simple python scripts that I wrote for the generation of figures. These have been added to the main thesis.
